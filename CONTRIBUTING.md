# Contributing to laravel-collective-spatie-html-parser

Thank you for considering contributing to this project! Your contributions help maintain and improve this Laravel compatibility layer, ensuring a smooth transition between the obsolete laravel-collective library to the maintained laravel-spatie-html. This library also helps to that old proyects to be updated to the new versions of Laravel.

## How to Contribute

### 1. Submitting a Pull Request (PR)
- Always create your PR against the `develop` branch.
- Use a **descriptive name** and provide a **clear description** of what the PR does (bug fix, new feature, improvement, etc.).
- Once reviewed and approved, I will merge it into `master` and handle the deployment.

### 2. Reporting Issues
If you encounter a bug but are unable to fix it yourself, you can still help by reporting it:
- Open a new **Issue** in the repository.
- Provide a **detailed description** of the issue.
- Include **steps to reproduce the problem** so others can verify and fix it.

## Code Style Guidelines
- Follow Laravelâ€™s coding standards and best practices.
- Keep the code clean and well-documented.
- Ensure that new features or fixes do not break existing functionality.

Thank you for your support and contributions!
